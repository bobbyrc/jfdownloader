## Usage

4. **Filter**: Select categories to narrow down your product list
5. **Download**: Click the download button and choose your destination folder
6. **Monitor**: Track download progress in the download panel

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with:

- **Models**: Data structures for products and download progress
- **Providers**: State management using the Provider pattern
- **Services**: HTTP clients for JustFlight API and download management
- **Screens**: Main UI screens (login, main dashboard)
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

## Web Scraping Approach

The application uses web scraping to interact with the JustFlight website since no official API is available. It:

1. Authenticates using the standard login form
2. Parses the user's download page to extract product information
3. Follows download links to access files
4. Maintains session cookies for authenticated requests

## Security and Privacy

- Credentials are only used for authentication and are not stored permanently
- Session cookies are stored locally and cleared on logout
- All communication uses HTTPS
- No personal data is transmitted to third parties
